  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The WY Crochet Club is a club at the Whitney M. Young Magnet High School which teaches members to crochet and then either donates crocheted items to charity or sells them where the proceeds are donated to charity.</li>
    <li>We strongly believe in giving back to our community and helping others in need, and with this club, weâ€™re able to do so in an effective and fun way. </li>
